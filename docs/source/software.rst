Software
========

Useful software. Descriptions are taken from the respective code homepages. 


Particle Physics
----------------

`LHAPDF <https://lhapdf.hepforge.org>`_
    LHAPDF is the standard tool for evaluating parton distribution functions (PDFs) in high-energy physics.

`Pythia <https://pythia.org>`_
    PYTHIA is a program for the generation of high-energy physics collision events


Neutrino propagation
--------------------

`nuFATE <https://github.com/aaronvincent/nuFATE>`_ 
    nuFATE is a code that rapidly calculates the attenuated neutrino flux as a function of energy, neutrino flavor and zenith angle, due to the earth's opacity.

`χarον <https://github.com/icecube/charon>`_
    χarον is a package to organize calculations of neutrinos from dark matter annihilation/decay. Nobody knows how to pronounce it.

`PEANUTS <https://github.com/michelelucente/PEANUTS>`_
    PEANUTS is a software for the automatic computation of solar neutrino flux and its propagation within Earth. It is designed to be fast, so that it can be efficiently used in global scans, and flexible, so it allows the input of custom solar models, Earth density profiles, etc.

Cosmic rays
-----------

PROPOSAL 
    I don't know where to find this software because of its ungooglable name.

Cosmology
---------

Dark Matter detection
---------------------

`DMprop <https://github.com/ccapp413/DMpropPublic>`_
    A semi-analytic approach to compute the velocity distribution of light dark matter after propagation through the atmosphere or an overburden.
