Astrophysics
------------

.. _m-200:

:math:`M_{200}`
***************
The mass of the galaxy enclosed in :math:`R_{200}` `R-200 <r-200_>`_.


.. _r-200:

:math:`R_{200}`
***************
The radius of a galaxy in which the average density
is 200 times the critical density of the universe.



Particle Physics
----------------

.. _bbn:

Big Bang Nucleosynthesis
************************
The brief point in time in the early universe that fused helium and lithium from
hydrogen.

.. _li-problem:

The Li Problem
**************
The mismatch between the observed abundance of lithium in comparison with
predictions from `BBN <bbn_>`_.

.. _uhe-events:

Upgoing Ultra-High-Energy (UHE) Events
*****************************************
Detection of what seems like UHE neutrinos made by `ANITA <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antarctic_Impulsive_Transient_Antenna>`_
coming up through the Earth out of the Antarctic ice sheet. Issue: the Earth
should be nearly opaque to UHE neutrinos (as the cross section scales with the
energy).

.. _false-vacuum:

False Vacuum
************
A field is in a local minimum of its potential, which is *not* the *global*
minimum of the potential (i.e. a *false* vacuum). As a result, there is potential energy that can be
released should the field move to the *true* vacuum.
