Harlow Shapley's advice on speaking
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

*Based on a* :download:`typewritten document <files/shapley.png>` *dated June-December 1948, scanned by the UC Boulder Libraries. I have very slightly de-gendered the original language and removed the jarring/amusing reference to lanterns:*

1. Face the audience. Remember that the speaker who talks to their screen or to their blackboard exposes their uninteresting back to an audience that wouldn't say such things to their face.


2. It is an old adage, based on extensive research, that people are more interested if what one says if they can hear it. Therefore speak to those on the back seats. If one must turn to the screen or the blackboard, raise the voice considerably. Speak clearly. The between-sentence or between-phrase gutteral "urrr" only reveals that the mind is skidding. 

3. In preparing your talk, imagine yourself in the place of your audience. Ask yourself: "would I care to listen to such details?" You will then discover that the audience:

    is not at all interested in details of observations or instruments when such details are not clearly relevant to an understanding of the nature of your work and your competence as a worker;

    is not interested in slides that contain too many columns and too many lines;

    is not pleased when you charge it with illiteracy by reading your slides;

    is not patient with poor slides, or with small drawings that you wave in the air at the front row;

 **But** the audience is likely interested in:

    The indication that you both enjoy and respect your problem and your contribution;

    the results of your work, rather than the details of your workings;

    the relation of your particular contribution to other contributions;

    what you propose to do to advance the project further.

4. I do not know which is more unsympathetically received by a techincal audience---one who presents themself and their work pompously, or one who simulates the shrinking violet. Best to be natural.

5. Please remember and remember and remember that the speaker who speaks longer than their allotted time is almost always detested by all of the audience. Ditto for one who says or intimates broadly that the presiding chair is cheating the audience by not giving longer time to such special work. They aren't cheating them. They are helping you to be concise and well-balanced. Anything that a speaker has to say after a chair has tried to beat them down is a total loss and generally tends to undo whatever good may have been built up during the allotted minutes. Some overtime speakers suffer from the delusion that they will impress fellow scientists by having much to say and being so eager to say it. Actually they are recognized as members of that unfortunate type that is both selfish about the rights of other speakers and apparently quite unable to to organize a presentation.

"It is remarkable," I heard Sir James Jeans say once in presiding at a meeting of the Royal Astronomical Society -- "It is remarkable how much one can say in ten minutes when the eleventh is not at his disposal."

December 1 1948                                                         H.S.

Rules for writing a PRL
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

*Copied without permission from the now-defunct web page of John Wilkins*

The basic idea is that the work should be understandably completely in terms of the Figures and their Captions. (Occasionally Tables and their Captions are also necessary.) As with any principle it appears to have exceptions but doesn't. With this in mind, here are the rules for writing an effective PRL to the prescribed length (425 lines).

1. Prepare the figures first; they must carry the load. Remember that they will in most cases be 3 3/8" wide, so narrow or square figures work best. All lettering must be high enough so that upon reduction it will be 2-3 mm. You can easily squeeze in much information with lettering; this will enable the figure to stand on its own. There is no limit to the number of figures. But usually it is hard to include more than four.
 
2. Next do the figure captions. The editorial style of the figure captions is as follows, the first "sentence" of a caption is not a sentence but a label (i.e., no verb). All subsequent sentences must be sentences (i.e., subject, verb, and object). The Figure with its Caption should be able to stand on its own. Don't say that important things can be found in the text.
 
3. Tables are the next item. Here you must pick and choose in order to prove your point(s); again the caption can help in telling the story.
 
4. Equations. (This is mainly for theorists). Prepare your equations. Never redefine a symbol. Don't use more than 12 equations. Work on their form until the equations are transparent; every symbol has an obvious meaning.
 
5. References. Make a serious estimate of what references you will use. Multiply by 1.40 to account for footnotes and omissions.
 
6. Now "copy cast." Use the rules on the back to calculate items 1-11 (on the back). Then the number of lines available for the text = 425 - (items 1-11).
 
6. If the number of available text lines is less than 100, you are probably trying to squeeze too much in. Think about removing one figure or redrawing them. Before you start writing, plan your major points; if some of them are not in the figures or tables, ask yourself if they could be.
 
8. The general rule of writing is: tell'em what you are going to tell'em; then tell'em; finally tell'em what you told them. In PRL this means that within the first three paragraphs you must present, as specifically as possible, the basic results of your work. This is not the same as the abstract which is a stand-alone specific description of the paper. The summary at the end is a chance to put the work in proper context.
 
9. Finally PRL requires you write a brief introduction (1-2 paragraphs) that sets your work in a context so that the general readers (i.e., not in your specialty) can figure why they should be interested in your paper. In writing, be pecific. Avoid the passive voice. Use short, single-idea paragraphs.
