Code of Conduct
===============

Members of the QHEAT group are expected to adhere to the following code of conduct in interactions within the group, the department, and the wider scientific community.

This code of conduct has been adapted from the `GAMBIT <http://www.gambitbsm.org>`_ community CoC. 

We expect all members of our the QHEAT group  a fundamentally collaborative attitude. Some key aspects of this are:

* Be supportive: Encourage and engage with the work of colleagues, and be generous in offering help.
* Be inclusive: Welcome and encourage contributions from everyonef. Be mindful of unhealthy social dynamics, and of biases at the individual level and group level that hinder inclusiveness. The latter may include e.g. bias due to race, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity or religious beliefs.
* Be considerate: Do not hold colleagues to unrealistic expectations, and show respect for their time and availability. Keep in mind that biases and discrimination, both conscious and subconscious, can negatively impact a colleague's work capacity. Pay attention to the well-being of your colleagues.
* Be pragmatic and willing to compromise.
* Display a healthy tolerance to criticism and to the opinions and values of others. Give others a fair chance to voice their opinion.
* In disagreements, assume in the first instance that others mean well.
* Be polite and respectful: Keep in mind that behaviours acceptable to one person may not be so to another. In all forms of communication avoid language and jokes that can make others feel uncomfortable. If in doubt, play it safe.
* Be receptive: Help foster an open atmosphere where it is OK to point out if something is not OK. Be mindful that actions and words can make others uncomfortable even when that is not even remotely the intent. Respond sensitively and with empathy to such reports.
* Recognise that each person will have their own interpretations of, thoughts and opinions on specific interactions between group members, and that these will likely be influenced by their past experiences. Recognise these as valid, even if they conflict with your own or those of other members, and try to be accommodating of them.

In the QHEAT we do not tolerate harassment, intimidation, bullying, discrimination, or any other form of mistreatment. As community members, each of us has a responsibility to take action if we observe conduct unacceptable by our code of conduct. Such actions may include:

* having a gentle conversation with the offending member(s) explaining what about their behaviour is undesirable, and why;
* reminding the offending member(s) of our shared code of conduct;
* reaching out to the victim(s) to offer support;
* discussing the situation with your supervisor;
* discussing the situation with another member of the department (e.g. head, another faculty member that you trust), or McDonald Institute staff.
* any such discussion is treated as confidential by default, unless explicit permission is given to share bring your concerns to another party.

In most cases, the preferred first course of action should be the gentle conversation. However, this necessarily depends on the nature of the observed misconduct, and must be judged on a case by case basis. We do not tolerate any retaliation against group members who report or participate in an investigation of a possible violation of our code of conduct, policies, or the law.
