=================

Astrophysics
------------

.. _m-200:

:math:`M_{200}`
***************
The mass of the galaxy enclosed in :math:`R_{200}` `R-200 <r-200_>`_.

.. _r-200:

:math:`R_{200}`
***************
The radius of a galaxy in which the average density
is 200 times the critical density of the universe.

.. _quazar:

Quazar
******
A supermassive black hole in the centre of a distant galaxy. The accreting
material heats up and is seen as a point source in radio. Its name comes from
'quasi-stellar object'.

.. _blazar:

Blazar
******
A `Quazar <quazar_>`_ that has its relativistic jet pointed straight at us.

.. _synchrotron-self-Compton:

Synchrotron self-Compton
************************
Electrons in a magnetic field emit synchrotron radiation, which then Compton
scatters off of the electrons, up-scattering to gamma-rays.

.. _milky-way-analogue:

Milky Way Analogue
******************

A galaxy with properties similar to our own. Used to understand our galaxy by
looking at similar ones that appear when performing simulations of the Universe.

.. _zoom-in-sim:

Zoom-In Simulation
******************

A cosmological simulation on Hubble scale. To get a better resolved simulation
of individual galaxies in this context, you re-run a small element taking note
of in-flow and out-flow from the larger scale simulation. This is done in post.


Particle Physics
----------------

.. _bbn:

Big Bang Nucleosynthesis
************************
The brief point in time in the early universe that fused helium and lithium from
hydrogen.

.. _li-problem:

The Li Problem
**************
The mismatch between the observed abundance of lithium in comparison with
predictions from `BBN <bbn_>`_.

.. _uhe-events:

Upgoing Ultra-High-Energy (UHE) Events
**************************************
Detection of what seems like UHE neutrinos made by `ANITA <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antarctic_Impulsive_Transient_Antenna>`_
coming up through the Earth out of the Antarctic ice sheet. Issue: the Earth
should be nearly opaque to UHE neutrinos (as the cross section scales with the
energy).

.. _false-vacuum:

False Vacuum
************
A field is in a local minimum of its potential, which is *not* the *global*
minimum of the potential (i.e. a *false* vacuum). As a result, there is potential energy that can be
released should the field move to the *true* vacuum.

.. _nu-matter-effect:

Neutrino Matter Effect
**********************
An extra interaction an incoming neutrino can have with the corresponding
flavour leptons in matter. Our matter is mostly composed of electrons, so
electron flavour neutrinos experience an extra component to oscillation.

.. _scotogenic-dm:

Scotogenic Dark Matter
**********************
Dark matter that can have a loop interaction with some new dark particle. The
notable feature is that the dark matter is transformed into a right-handed
neutrino inside this loop. These models can then explain the origin of neutrino
masses.
