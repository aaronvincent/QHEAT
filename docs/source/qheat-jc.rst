QHEAT Journal Club
===============
We host our journal club over on
`Benty Fields <https://www.benty-fields.com/>`_. From there you can make an
account and join via the **Journal Clubs** tab. We vote for papers and usually
discuss ones at the top of the list with the most votes. Vote for papers already
on the list you find interesting, and suggest papers by giving them an initial
vote by either using Benty Fields' built-in paper browser under the **Papers**
tab, or searching for specific papers under the **Benty-search** tab.

Finding Papers
--------------
To stay up-to-date, you can browse the daily new submissions in the
`ArXiV preprint server <https://arxiv.org>`_. We typically browse the High
Energy Physics - Phenomenology (`hep-ph <https://arxiv.org/archive/hep-ph>`_)
section, so that is a good place to start.
