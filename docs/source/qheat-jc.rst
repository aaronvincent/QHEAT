QHEAT Journal Club
===============
We host our journal club over on
`Benty Fields <https://www.benty-fields.com/>`_. From there you can make an
account and join via the **Journal Clubs** tab. We vote for papers and usually
discuss ones at the top of the list with the most votes. Vote for papers already
on the list you find interesting, and suggest papers by giving them an initial
vote by either using Benty Fields' built-in paper browser under the **Papers**
tab, or searching for specific papers under the **Benty-search** tab.

Finding Papers
--------------
To stay up-to-date, you can browse the daily new submissions in the
`ArXiV preprint server <https://arxiv.org>`_. We typically browse the High
Energy Physics - Phenomenology (`hep-ph <https://arxiv.org/archive/hep-ph>`_)
section, so that is a good place to start.

Subscribing to ArXiV
********************
If you prefer, you can have the new ArXiV submissions emailed to you
automatically instead of visiting the server
`as explained here <https://info.arxiv.org/help/subscribe.html>`_. If you want
to just quickly subscribe to *hep-ph*, then simply send an email from the email
account you want to receive the daily submissions, adding your name:

.. code-block:: text

	To: physics@arxiv.org
	Subject: subscribe John Smith

	add High Energy Physics - Phenomenology

And to unsubscribe:

.. code-block:: text

	To: physics@arxiv.org
	Subject: subscribe John Smith

	del High Energy Physics - Phenomenology
