Glossary of Terms
=================

A crowdsourced glossary of terms that have come up during journal club discussions. 

Astrophysics
------------

.. _blazar:

Blazar
******
A `Quasar <quasar_>`_ that has its relativistic jet pointed straight at us.

.. _m-200:

:math:`M_{200}`
***************
The mass of the galaxy enclosed in :math:`R_{200}` `R-200 <r-200_>`_.

.. _milky-way-analogue:

Milky Way Analogue
******************
A galaxy with properties similar to our own. Used to understand our galaxy by
looking at similar ones that appear when performing simulations of the Universe.

.. _pta:

Pulsar Timing Array
*******************
Measurements of the changing time delay of multiple pulsars. One can look for
gravitational waves by looking for correlations between the the position of the
pulsars in the sky with their differing time delays.

.. _quasar:

Quasar
******
A supermassive black hole in the centre of a distant galaxy. The accreting
material heats up and is seen as a point source in radio. Its name comes from
'quasi-stellar object'.

.. _r-200:

:math:`R_{200}`
***************
The radius of a galaxy in which the average density
is 200 times the critical density of the universe.

.. _synchrotron-self-Compton:

Synchrotron self-Compton
************************
Electrons in a magnetic field emit synchrotron radiation, which then Compton
scatters off of the electrons, up-scattering to gamma-rays.

.. _zoom-in-sim:

Zoom-In Simulation
******************
A cosmological simulation on galactic scales. To get a better resolved simulation
of individual galaxies in this context, you re-run a small element taking note
of in-flow and out-flow from the larger scale simulation.


Particle Physics
----------------

.. _bao:

Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO)
*********************************
In the early universe, matter is drawn into over-densities by gravity, but only
baryons (and not dark matter) experience a pressure that causes them to rebound
outward and undergo oscillations. These propagate at the sound speed of the
medium. Galaxies are more likely to form where these oscillations stopped,
and we observe this as a spatial correlation of the position of galaxies in the
current universe.

.. _bbn:

Big Bang Nucleosynthesis
************************
The brief point in time in the early universe that fused helium and lithium from
hydrogen.

.. _bogoliubov:

Bogoliubov Transformation
*************************
Observers in different reference frames will not agree on the vacuum state. The
transformation between theses observers is the Bogoliubov transformation.

.. _false-vacuum:

False Vacuum
************
A field is in a local minimum of its potential, which is *not* the *global*
minimum of the potential (i.e. a *false* vacuum). As a result, there is potential energy that can be
released should the field move to the *true* vacuum.

.. _inelastic-dm:

Inelastic Dark Matter
*********************
Dark matter models that have two particles (or states) that have different
masses, with a mass splitting defined as their difference.

.. _kination:

Kination
********
The period in which a scalar field's potential is negligible and its kinetic
energy dominates the universe. The field is said to be kinating in this period.

.. _li-problem:

The Li Problem
**************
The mismatch between the observed abundance of lithium in comparison with
predictions from `BBN <bbn_>`_.

.. _nu-hierarchy:

Neutrino Hierarchy
******************
Neutrinos are known to have a non-zero mass, and we have measured the magnitude
of two mass splittings through atmospheric and solar neutrino measurements.
Depending on the sign of the splitting, we either have *normal* ordering with
one heavy state and two lighter states or *inverted* ordering with two heavier
states and one light state.

.. _nu-matter-effect:

Neutrino Matter Effect
**********************
An extra interaction an incoming neutrino can have with the corresponding
flavour leptons in matter. Our matter is mostly composed of electrons, so
electron flavour neutrinos experience an extra component to oscillation.

.. _scotogenic-dm:

Scotogenic Dark Matter
**********************
Dark matter that can have a loop interaction with some new dark particle. The
notable feature is that the dark matter is transformed into a right-handed
neutrino inside this loop. These models can then explain the origin of neutrino
masses.

.. _uhe-events:

Upgoing Ultra-High-Energy (UHE) Events
**************************************
Detection of what seems like UHE neutrinos made by `ANITA <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antarctic_Impulsive_Transient_Antenna>`_
coming up through the Earth out of the Antarctic ice sheet. Issue: the Earth
should be nearly opaque to UHE neutrinos (as the cross section scales with the
energy).
